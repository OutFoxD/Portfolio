Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll find an overview of my hardware and software projects. Each project includes a brief description, goals, key technologies used, and links to repositories or pictures.

## üöÄ Featured Projects

### **Mobile Battery-supplied Lab Power Supply**
- **Description:** This supply can power anything up to 55 Volts and 6 Amps, while being completely mobile. It combines a 14s2p spot welded battery made of recycled 18650 cells, with an adjustable DC-DC converter in a 3D printed enclosure.  In total the supply comes in under 2 kg and can deliver maximum power for about an hour (~300 Wh of energy).
- **Goals:** Backup-charge my e-scooter from 0-100 % SoC within 2 hrs
- **Technologies Used:**  Spot welding, 3D printing, DC-DC buck conversion, Soldering, CAD
- **Repository:** [Mobile-Battery-supplied-Lab-Power-Supply](https://github.com/OutFoxD/Mobile-Battery-supplied-Lab-Power-Supply)

### **Hacked electronic load**
- **Description:** 
- **Goals:** Improved usability with separate UI board and a rotary encoder
- **Technologies Used:**  Raspberry Pi Pico, Rotary Encoder, 3D Printing, CAD, Soldering

## üíª Past Projects

### **Hacked humidifier with active control**
- **Description:** 
- **Goals:** Operation withing optimal humidity range (60-80 %RH) to promote tropical plant growth
- **Technologies Used:**  Raspberry Pi Pico, OLED Display, 3D Printing, Temp and Humidity Sensing

### **Temp and Humidity logging from Tado Thermostats**
- **Description:** Simple logging of hemperature and humidity was set up with the data from Tado radiator thermostats. I pull the data from the TadoAPI - a local way to get it was not in place, when I realized the project.
After the data is gatered it's saved to an InfluxDB and later visualized in Grafana.
Grafana also does the conversion from relative to absolute humidity.
- **Goals:** Gaining Insights how my flat heats up during summer and how and when washed clothes are fullie dried
- **Technologies Used:** Raspberry Pi 4, Docker, NodeRed, Grafana, InfluxDB, TadoAPI
